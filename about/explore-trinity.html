Both Trinity and Columbia have grown over the last 200 years, taking us from a small, country church to an urban parish with more than 3,600 baptized members.Â </p><p>In November 1976, the Diocese of Upper South Carolina voted to make Trinity Church, Columbia, its cathedral parish. Over the course of Trinity's history, we have been the spiritual home to members of Congress, judges, legislators, and governors, and we've played a leading role in the affairs of the city, the state, and the church.</p><p>Our <a href="https://digital.tcl.sc.edu/digital/collection/trinity/search">digital archive collection</a> is available through the University of South Carolina Library.</p><h3>A Churchyard of Distinguished Graves and Historic Trees</h3><p>Under the ancient oaks and magnolias of Trinityâs Churchyard are buried some of South Carolinaâs distinguished sons and daughters: General Wade Hampton, General Peter Horry, and Private Robert Stark (all Revolutionary heroes); Dr. Thomas Cooper, president of the South Carolina College (now the University of South Carolina) and friend of Thomas Jefferson; General Wade Hampton; Henry Timrod, Poet Laureate of the Confederacy; six governors of the state; and eight bishops of the Episcopal Church.</p><h3>The Famous Windows of Trinity Cathedral</h3><p>The great love Trinityâs parishioners have always had for their place of worship can be seen in every detail, and most especially in our stained glass windows. Click through the images below to get a full view of our windows, or come by to see them in person - this is just a fraction of our collection, and their in-person impact cannot be overstated.</p></div>

        <div data-item="0"><p>Saint Paul holds a book in his left hand as testimony to his writings and a sword in his right hand. At Ephesians 6:17 Paul advises his followers âAnd take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God.â Behind Paul is a sailboat, on which he traveled around the eastern Mediterranean to meet his congregations (Acts 13.4,13). Acts 27 &amp; 28 tell of his voyage to Rome to face charges. He sails up the coast of Asia Minor in a coasting vessel, probably like the one depicted here, to the island of Malta, where he is shipwrecked.<span> </span>He then proceeds to Rome in a large boat conveying wheat from Egypt to Rome.</p><p>The crossed swords at the top of the window are also representative of this saintâone refers to the good fight he fought, the other to his martyrdom by the sword. The bottom of the window carries another emblem associated with Saint Paulâthe serpent and the fire. In Acts 28:2-6 a viper attacks and bites him while shipwrecked on Malta.<span>Â </span>Paul threw the viper into the fire. The natives waited for his collapse and certain death, but when he survived, they pronounced him âa god.â</p><p>This window was created by Powell and Sons Company/Whitefriars of London, England.<span>Â </span></p><p><strong>Memorial: </strong>This window was given by the congregation of Trinity Church to the glory of God and in loving memory of the Right Reverend Louis Chester Melcher, D.D. (1898-1965). The memorial is fitting, for just as St. Paul journeyed to the gentiles as the great apostle, so too did Bishop Melcher journey to Brazil in 1948 as a missionary bishop. He served as rector at Trinity from 1939-1948 and is buried in the churchyard.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph-field content-field field-text" data-item-count="1">
        <div data-item="0"><p><em>One of four windows in Seibels Chapel that depict events in the life of Christ. These windows were created by Hugh Easton of England, who also created and executed the windows in Westminster Abbey that honor the RAF pilots from World War II. These windows were installed in the 1950s when Seibels Chapel was constructed as an addition to the Cathedral.Â </em></p><p>A descending dove over the baptismal font symbolizes Baptism. In the story of the baptism of Jesus, Mark says the Holy Spirit descended âlike a dove.â (Mark 1:10)</p><p>The wafer and chalice represent the Eucharist. The chalice is the âcupâ (or âHoly Grailâ) that Jesus used at the institution of the Lordâs Supper. (Matt. 26:17-9)</p><p>Interlocking rings with the symbol represent marriage. The Greek letter chi (X) is the first letter of the Greek word for âChrist.â (Î§ÏÎ¹ÏÏÎ¿Ï) The Greek letter rho (Î¡) is the second letter of Christâs name in Greek. They are laid one on the other to make a monogram. The rings signify the joining of a man and a woman in unending union; the symbol indicates the presence of Christ in the marriage.</p><p>Ordination is represented by the chasuble (sleeveless outer vestment) with gold orphrey (bands of rich embroidery usually on the back of the chasuble and forming a cross) and the stole, traditional clerical vestments reaching to the ankles, close-sleeved, and girded at the waist with an opening in the center to go over the head of the celebrant. The chasuble represents the robe the Roman soldiers placed on Christ after they scourged him (John 19:2). The stoleâa long band worn over the shoulders and down both sides of the frontâsignifies the ordination of the wearer and marks the sacredness of the sacramentals. It represents immortality, the yolk of obedience, and the reign of Christ.</p><p>Two keys, one gold and one silver crossed saltire (St. Andrewâs Cross) refer to Matthew 16:19, where Jesus said to Peter, âI will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.â The colors gold and silver refer to heaven and earth and the keys represent Penance, a sacramental rite involving repentance, acceptance of penalties, and absolution.</p><p>Flames and a sword represent Confirmation. Flames represent the gifts of the Holy Spirit. The sword often portrays courage against the forces of evilâthe Christian witness to God the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit against sin, death, and the devil. It becomes âthe sword of the spiritââthe responsibility of those confirmed to bear witness to Christ.</p><p><strong>Memorial: </strong>The Seibels Chapel was given by Edwin Grenville &amp; Rosamund Kershaw Seibels and John Jacob &amp; Bertha Willingham Seibels in memory of the members of the Seibels family who have worshiped in this parish.</p></div>

        <div data-item="0"><p>After the death of Dr. Peter Shand (1800-1886), Rector of Trinity for over 50 years, the congregation took up a collection for a suitable memorial. The result was that the five lancets of the original apse were replaced by this great window, called âThe Shand Windowâ and the four accompanying Belcher lancets. The tablet was inscribed with a tribute to Dr. Shand and placed in the eastern wall of the chancel.</p><p>In the middle window, Jesus holds a child in his arms; a young woman kneels at his feet with her arms around another child. Matthew 19:14 recalls the time when Jesus, rebuking his disciples, said to them âSuffer little children, and forbid them not, to come unto me: for of such is the kingdom of heaven.â</p><p>In the arch of this window is a quatrefoilâa beautifully crafted ornamental design of a four-petaled flower.</p><p>The four adjacent lancets feature the quatrefoil with four candlesticks decorated at their base with Messianic (or Christian) roses, (five white petals with yellow styles and stamens in the center), a symbol of the Messiah. Isaiah 35:1 says that when the Messiah comes into the world it will be like a desert that will âblossom as the rose.â Combined with the candlestick, it is a symbol that Christ, âthe Light of the Worldâ (John 8:12), is the fulfillment of the Old Testament prophecy.</p><p>These windows and the windows over the doors going into the Legislative Hall of the SC State House across the street make up one of the largest collections of Belcher Mosaic Glass in the world, outside of a museum. The quatrefoil is present in each of these four windows as well. These five windows in the apse behind the altar make an exquisite centerpiece for the cathedralâs other windows.</p><p><strong>Memorial: </strong>A memorial to the Reverend Peter Johnson Shand, D.D., was given by his congregation in loving commemoration of his faithful ministry at trinity church. Dr. Shand came from Charleston, S.C., in 1833 as a lay reader. He was ordained to the priesthood, became rector of Trinity in 1834, and served in that capacity until his death on All Saintsâ Day 1886. He is interred in the churchyard.</p></div>

        <div data-item="0"><p>It is appropriate that St. Stephen be next to St. Paul, since as Saul before his conversion, Paul both supported and witnessed the execution of St. Stephen. (Acts 8:1)</p><p>Acts 6:1-15 and 7:55-60 say Saint Stephen was the first-century martyr accused before the Sanhedrin. He was one of seven deacons appointed by the apostles to distribute alms.</p><p>Many Hebraic Jews objected to his preaching and charged him with blasphemy against Moses and God. While he was being charged, he saw a vision and was dragged out and stoned.</p><p>The two angels above St. Stephen represent the heavens and his vision. They are holding the rocks with which Saint Stephen was stoned and a book representing his studies.</p><p>Saint Stephen is dressed in a deaconâs dalmatic, a form of dress appropriate today but perhaps not in use in the first century.</p><p>This window was executed by Willet Studios of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, founded by William Willet (1869-1921) in 1899 partly in opposition to the wide use of opalescent glass, such as that in the Narthex partition. Willet thought that transparent stained glass better served the architectural purpose of windows and he emphasized the use of traditional medieval materials and techniques. Â By winning the commission over Louis Comfort Tiffany and others for the Cadet Chapel at the US Military Academy at West Point in 1910, he was considered the leading American stained glass artist. (Waggoner) His company today is known as Willet Hauser Architectural Glass. Â </p><p><strong>Memorial: </strong>Given by Frances Harvey Morris and family.</p></div>

        <div data-item="0"><p>This pair of lancets comprise one of the two windows in the Cathedral that illustrate the four prophets of the Old Testament. These portrayals of the Old Testament Prophets provide a wonderful parallel for the four Evangelists who are portrayed in the Narthex windows.</p><p>Daniel, who lived during the Babylonian Captivity, is shown in the center of the lancet with his hands together in prayer, as he did three times daily (Daniel 6:10). Daniel was known for his various visions in which he saw the future of Israel and the world.</p><p>The ramâs head at the top of the right lancet depicts Danielâs vision of a two-horned ram, which drives away those in all directions with impunity. The two horns represent the kings of the Medes and Persians (Daniel 8:8-9, 20).</p><p>At the bottom of the lancet, a lion reminds us of the story of Daniel in the lion-pit. Daniel 6:16-23 says King Darius issued an edict that said if anyone should present a petition to any god or human other than the king himself, that person would be thrown into the lion-pit. When Daniel disregarded the edict and continued to pray to his god, his enemies quickly told King Darius, who, with reluctance, followed through on his threat. As Daniel was being cast into the pit, the king said, âThy God whom thou servest continually, he will deliver thee.â When the king returned the next day, he found that God had sent an angel to close the lionsâ mouths and Daniel was saved.</p><p>Ezekiel, portrayed in the left lancet, is known for his prophecies regarding the destruction of Jerusalem and its temple, the restoration to Israel, and the new temple. Like Daniel, he lived during the Babylonian Captivity in the 6th century BC. Ezekielâs right hand is raised in blessing, his left hand holds a model of the new temple. As an exiled priest, he dealt with the everyday problems of worship in a foreign land, dreamed of a new Jerusalem, inspired hope and faith in his fellow exiles, and influenced the development of the synagogue.</p><p>Willet Studios executed these two lancet windows.</p><p><strong>Memorial: </strong>This window was given by family and friends to the glory of God and in loving memory of the Right Reverend John Adams Pinckney, 1905â1972, and Hilda P. Pinckney, Bishop Of The Diocese Of Upper South Carolina from 1963 to 1972. Bishop Pinckney is interred in the churchyard.</p></div>

        <div data-item="0"><p>This pair of lancets depict Old Testament prophets. Their arches are obscured in the church by a balcony support, but the obscured portion contains no pictorial subjects.</p><p>Jeremiah (right lancet), the ninth of the prophets is generally believed to be the author of the Book of Jeremiah, 1 Kings, 2 Kings, and the Book of Lamentations and is cited in the New Testament (Hebrews 8:8-12; 10.16-17). He lived in the late 7th century BC, some 60 years after the death of Isaiah. He correctly predicted the fall of Jerusalem and the destruction of Solomonâs Temple (Jeremiah 38:2). He was persecuted by his family, priests, and the princes of Judah, who threw him into a cistern, depicted at the top of this window, atop palm leaves, symbols of rejoicing.</p><p>Jeremiah is shown holding a stone. Tradition says he was stoned to death by the Jews in Egypt because of his unpopular messages against the rebellious Israelites.</p><p>Isaiah (left lancet) was a prophet who lived in the Kingdom of Judah in the 8-7th centuries B.C. when Assyria conquered the Kingdom of Israel, Judahâs northern neighbor. Judah allied itself with the Assyrians, lest its chief city, Jerusalem fall. Isaiah 37:1-23 tells of Isaiahâs prophecy to Judahâs king Hezekiah that God would visit His wrath on the invaders. The Assyrians lost 185,000 men and the king never attacked Judah again. (2 Kings 19; 2 Chronicles 32) Isaiah is best known for his âSong of the Suffering Servant,â (Isaiah 52:13-53:12), widely taken by Christians as a prophecy of the coming of the nature, suffering, and death of Jesus Christ. According to John 12:41, Isaiah âsaw [Jesusâ] glory and spake of him.â</p><p>Isaiah is here portrayed holding a saw. The Talmud (Yevamot 49b) and the Muslim tradition record that after the death of Hezekiah the unrighteous Israelites had Isaiah executed by being sawn in half (as was the Apostle James the Lesser), but there is no Christian authority for this.</p><p>The top of the window shows the scroll on which he recorded his prophecies, and a pair of tongs with which a seraph placed a live coal on Isaiahâs lips to purge him of his sins. (Isaiah 6.5-7)</p><p>The Willet Studio executed these two lancet windows.</p><p><strong>Memorial: </strong>This window was given to the glory of God and in loving memory of Jane Tucker Dana (1896-1972) and Francis Johnstone Dana (1890-1981) by Frank J. Dana, Frank J. Dana Jr., and Anne Dana Beach.</p></div>

It was made by Franz Mayer &amp; Co. of Munich, Germany, one of the worldâs foremost studios for stained glass, founded in 1848.</p><p>Jesus was brought to Jerusalem to be presented to the Lord according to the law that required âa pair of turtledoves, or two young pigeonsâ as a sacrifice (Luke 2:24)</p><p>Luke 2: 25-40 records the story of Simeon, a just and devout man who was told by the Holy Spirit that he should not see death before he had seen the Messiah. Guided by the Holy Spirit, he went to the temple. When Mary and Joseph brought in the child âto do for him after the custom of the law,â (2:27) Simeon took him in his arms and praised the Lord saying: âLord, now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace, according to thy word. For mine eyes have seen thy salvation, which thou hast prepared before the face of all people; a light to lighten the Gentiles, and the glory of thy people Israel.â (2:29-32)</p><p>This passage appears also in the services of Evening Prayer and Compline in the Book of Common Prayer under the title <em>Nunc Dimittis</em>.</p><p>Luke 2:36-38 tells the story of Anna, who, after her husbandâs death, ânever left the temple but worshipped night and day with fasting and prayer.â She came upon the scene in the temple, thanked the Lord, and began to talk âabout the child to all who were looking for the liberation of Jerusalem.â</p><p><strong>Memorial: </strong>The window was given to the glory of God and in loving memory of Hugh Smith Thompson (1836-1904) and Elizabeth Clarkson Thompson (1840-1909) by their children and grandchildren. The Thompson burial plot is located just outside this window in the churchyard.</p></div>

        <div data-item="0"><p>A rose window is formed like a great rose blossom in full bloom. Each petal of this window graphically presents twelve unique sayings of Jesus, (beginning at the position of one oâclock and moving clockwise).</p><ul><li>âI that speaketh unto thee am he [the Messiah]â (John 4:26) is depicted by the letters IHÎ£ at the heart of the sunburst.</li><li>âI am the bread of lifeâ (John 6:35) is depicted by wheat and a loaf of bread combined with the crux ansata (Latin: âcross with a handleâ), after the Egyptian hieroglyph Ankh, which means âlife.â</li><li>At Rev. 21:6 Jesus said âI will give unto him that is athirst of the fountain of the water of life.â The petal shows lambs drinking from a fountain of water pouring from a rock.</li><li>âBefore Abraham was, I amâ (John 8:58) is depicted by the palm branch of triumph, peace, and eternal life and crown of eternal rule.</li><li>âI am the light of the worldâ (John 8:12) is depicted by a candle lighting the globe.</li><li>âI am the doorâ (John 10:9) is depicted by a door.</li><li>âFor God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son, that whoever believeth in him should not perish, but have eternal life.â (John 3:16) is depicted by a hand. The hand is probably the best-known symbol of God the Father and the only one used for the first eight centuries.</li><li>âI am the true vine, and my Father is the husbandmanâ (John 15:1) is depicted by a grapevine and grapes.</li><li>âI am the way, the truth, and the lifeâ (John 14:6) is depicted by the combination of a path, a flaming torch, and the cross of life.</li><li>âYe call me Master and Lord: and ye say well; for I amâ (John 13:13) is depicted by a crown and scepter.</li><li>âI am the resurrection, and the lifeâ (John 11:25) is depicted by the phoenix, a mythological bird believed by the ancients to set its nest and itself on fire when old, only to be subsequently resurrected from the ashes.</li><li>âI am alpha (A) and omega (â¦), the beginning and the end, the first and the last.â (Rev. 22:13) Alpha and omega are the first and last letters of the Greek alphabet, symbolizing the eternity of our Savior.</li></ul><p><br />At the heart of the rose is the lamb of God, Agnus Dei. The lamb was a sacrificial animal in antiquity, which came to symbolize Jesus, who was sacrificed for our sins: St. John the Baptist, just after the baptism of Jesus, twice pointed him out saying, âBehold the lamb of God which taketh away the sin of the worldâ (John 1,29,36).</p><p>This window was created by the Willet Studios of Philadelphia, PA.</p><p><span><strong>Memorial:</strong> This window was given by the Hampton family as a memorial to all the members of the Hampton family, who have served this place since its founding in 1812.</span></p></div>

These windows were created by Hugh Easton of England, who also created and executed the windows in Westminster Abbey that honor the RAF pilots from World War II. These windows were installed in the 1950s when Seibels Chapel was constructed as an addition to the Cathedral.Â </em></p><p>The cross in the foreground and the crown of thorns represent Christâs victory over death, selfishness, and pride by his suffering, death, and resurrection. This crown, plaited by the soldiers and placed on the head of Jesus during his trial before Pilate, was a mockery, a symbol of humiliation and suffering (John 19:2).</p><p>The feet of Christ ascending commemorate the ascension of Christ to heaven on the fortieth day after Easter, âHoly Thursday,â (Acts 1:9).</p><p>The shield of the blessed Trinity is pictured with the three curving sides, equal in length, carrying the Latin words, ânon estâ (is not), while the short straight bands have the word âestâ (is). The outer circles bear the words âPaterâ (Father), âFiliusâ (Son), and âSpiritus Sanctusâ (Holy Spirit). The inner circle bears the word âDeusâ (God). The circles emphasize eternity and Godâs never-ending love.</p><p>The Dove is the usual symbol of the Holy Spirit and always contains the triradiate nimbus around its head. The dove represents the descent of the Holy Spirit at Jesusâs baptism, and thus the gift of Godâs guidance at baptism.</p><p>The cross and white banner with red cross symbolize Christâs victory over death, sin, and the devil. The white banner represents the body of Christ, which is attached to the cruciform staff; the staff represents the cross on which Jesus died and through which the risen Christ saves the world. Red symbolizes the blood of martyrs.</p><p>The coins, basin, and towel represent Maundy Thursday, the betrayal of Judas, and the Last Supper. The coins are an emblem of the treachery of Judas in his conspiracy with the chief priests to betray Jesus (Matthew 26:15). On the night Jesus was betrayed, Maundy Thursday, he and his disciples met for the last meal together. He took a basin and washed their feet (John 13:5). This symbol along with the towel represents his humility and servitude, the evidence of Christâs love, and his estimate of true greatness in his kingdom.</p></div>

Carried by the Jews as a sign of triumphant rejoicing, the palm branches were spread before Jesus as he rode into Jerusalem just before his crucifixion (John 12:13).</p><p>The scourges, a symbol of passion, express the forty lashes minus one that Jesus suffered before his crucifixion.

Symbols at the top of the lancets explain each womanâs role. The low stoolâthe stool on which she sat at the masterâs feetâsymbolizes Mary. The water containerâthe symbol of liturgical purificationâsymbolizes Martha and parallels the cleansing of the house.</p><p>In the lower scene, another meeting between Jesus and this family of Bethany is illustrated. The scene includes Lazarus, the brother of Mary and Martha, whom Jesus had raised from the dead. (John 11) Mary anoints the feet of Jesus with costly ointment and wipes them with her hair. Judas, the groupâs treasurer, remonstrates at this extravagance; but Jesus replies, âThe poor always ye have with you, but me ye have not alwaysâ (John 12:8).</p><p>Memorial: This window was given to honor and hold in memory the Women of Trinity Cathedral Parish who have not only given faithful service but have sought a close relationship with God and the Christian family. Their names are listed on a plaque near the window. The donors are listed in the Trinity Memorials book.</p></div>

The other workers complain that they have not been paid more than those who were hired later. Jesus says to one of them, âdidst not thou agree with me for a penny?

The father replies that âIt was meet that we should make merry, and be glad: for this thy brother was dead, and is alive again; and was lost and is found.â (Luke 15:32)</p><p>In the left lancet, the rather poorly dressed son returns home as the industrious brother sits behind him with a spade. In the right lancet the father rushes to embrace his son with the fatted calf in the background. The tracery light contains a trident symbolizing the Trinity.</p><p><span>In August of 1976, the Very Reverend James Stirling (1913-1979), Rector, then Dean of Trinity (1961-1978), corresponded with Henry Willet of Willet Studios in Philadelphia regarding replacing the clear glass of the original clerestory windows with stained glass. Mr. Willet suggested the miracles and parables of Jesus as subject matter and his studio executed the windows.

The fish is the earliest of Christian symbols.</p><p>The upper portion of the lancet at the far left illustrates the Creation story of Gen. The three central lancets derive from Revelation. At the center sits the Son, Jesus Christ, his hands and feet bearing the stigmata. Below the figure of Christ, in the lower portion of the central window, are seven candlesticks representing the seven churches of Asia (Rev. 1:20) Beneath these, a lamb stands on a book with seven seals and bears aloft the banner of victory of life over sin and death. (Rev.5) When the lamb opens the book seal by seal, he marks the Second Coming of Jesus. (Rev.6) To the left of the lamb are the four Old Testament prophets (Rev. 5:8-9). To the right of the lamb are four New Testament apostles.</p><p>The upper portion of the far right lancet illustrates Acts 2:2-13, showing the Holy Spirit in the form of a dove, as it appeared to Jesus in all four Gospels (Matt 3:16; Mark 1:10; Luke 3:22; John 1:32). In the lower portion of the leftmost lancet are four theologians. Below the saddle bar of the Great West Window are depictions of four American or English bishops and one preacher.</p><p>Henry Willet of Willet Glass worked with Bishop Fitz Allison on the design and execution of the Trinity Window, which was installed in 1968; and Willet Glass has, since then, done the remaining stained glass windows in the Cathedral.</p><p><strong>Memorial: </strong>This window was given in memory of Dr. J.

He is credited with writing 14 of the 27 books of the New Testament. Originally a persecutor of Christians named Saul of Tarsus, who witnessed and supported the stoning of St. Stephen, he was journeying from Jerusalem to Damascus on business when the resurrected Jesus appeared in a light that blinded Saul for three days. (Acts 9:1-29) At the top of the left lancet a beacon is inscribed with the words Jesus spoke to Saul: âSaul, why persecutest thou me?â (Acts 9:4) Blinding light from the beacon shines down on the group. The inscription reads âSuddenly there shone from Heaven a great light.â Below the inscription are the emblems of Paul, a book, indicating the scriptures surmounting a sword, the symbol of his martyrdom.</p><p>The right lancet shows St. Paul preaching to the Athenians outside the court that tried murder and corruption charges in Athens, the Areopagus (in the background is the triangular pediment of a Greek temple with columns). Paul tells the Athenians that they have an altar to an unknown god, to whom they pray in their ignorance, but the God who made the world does not live in âtemples made with hands.â (Acts 17:22-24). He tells them of the Resurrection; some scoff but some want to hear more later. The inscription reads, âAnd hath made of one blood all nations of men.â (Acts 17:26) Below the inscription is a cross with flame behind it, recalling Paulâs words, âThe Lord commanded us, saying, I have set thee to be a light of the Gentiles, that thou shouldst be for salvation unto the ends of the earth.

To judge by the nimbus surrounding the figureâs body, he is probably an angel adorned with blond hair that is typical of Macedonians like Alexander the Great. The large Roman province of Macedonia incorporated ancient Macedonia and many other territories.

At Ephesians 6:17 Paul advises his followers âAnd take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God.â Behind Paul is a sailboat, on which he traveled around the eastern Mediterranean to meet his congregations (Acts 13.4,13). Acts 27 &amp; 28 tell of his voyage to Rome to face charges.

He served as rector at Trinity from 1939-1948 and is buried in the churchyard.</p></div>

        <div data-item="0"><p><em>One of four windows in Seibels Chapel that depict events in the life of Christ. These windows were created by Hugh Easton of England, who also created and executed the windows in Westminster Abbey that honor the RAF pilots from World War II. These windows were installed in the 1950s when Seibels Chapel was constructed as an addition to the Cathedral.Â </em></p><p>A descending dove over the baptismal font symbolizes Baptism. In the story of the baptism of Jesus, Mark says the Holy Spirit descended âlike a dove.â (Mark 1:10)</p><p>The wafer and chalice represent the Eucharist. The chalice is the âcupâ (or âHoly Grailâ) that Jesus used at the institution of the Lordâs Supper. (Matt. 26:17-9)</p><p>Interlocking rings with the symbol represent marriage. The Greek letter chi (X) is the first letter of the Greek word for âChrist.â (Î§ÏÎ¹ÏÏÎ¿Ï) The Greek letter rho (Î¡) is the second letter of Christâs name in Greek. They are laid one on the other to make a monogram. The rings signify the joining of a man and a woman in unending union; the symbol indicates the presence of Christ in the marriage.</p><p>Ordination is represented by the chasuble (sleeveless outer vestment) with gold orphrey (bands of rich embroidery usually on the back of the chasuble and forming a cross) and the stole, traditional clerical vestments reaching to the ankles, close-sleeved, and girded at the waist with an opening in the center to go over the head of the celebrant. The chasuble represents the robe the Roman soldiers placed on Christ after they scourged him (John 19:2). The stoleâa long band worn over the shoulders and down both sides of the frontâsignifies the ordination of the wearer and marks the sacredness of the sacramentals. It represents immortality, the yolk of obedience, and the reign of Christ.</p><p>Two keys, one gold and one silver crossed saltire (St. Andrewâs Cross) refer to Matthew 16:19, where Jesus said to Peter, âI will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.â The colors gold and silver refer to heaven and earth and the keys represent Penance, a sacramental rite involving repentance, acceptance of penalties, and absolution.</p><p>Flames and a sword represent Confirmation. Flames represent the gifts of the Holy Spirit. The sword often portrays courage against the forces of evilâthe Christian witness to God the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit against sin, death, and the devil. It becomes âthe sword of the spiritââthe responsibility of those confirmed to bear witness to Christ.</p><p><strong>Memorial: </strong>The Seibels Chapel was given by Edwin Grenville &amp; Rosamund Kershaw Seibels and John Jacob &amp; Bertha Willingham Seibels in memory of the members of the Seibels family who have worshiped in this parish.</p></div>

        <div data-item="0"><p>After the death of Dr. Peter Shand (1800-1886), Rector of Trinity for over 50 years, the congregation took up a collection for a suitable memorial. The result was that the five lancets of the original apse were replaced by this great window, called âThe Shand Windowâ and the four accompanying Belcher lancets. The tablet was inscribed with a tribute to Dr. Shand and placed in the eastern wall of the chancel.</p><p>In the middle window, Jesus holds a child in his arms; a young woman kneels at his feet with her arms around another child. Matthew 19:14 recalls the time when Jesus, rebuking his disciples, said to them âSuffer little children, and forbid them not, to come unto me: for of such is the kingdom of heaven.â</p><p>In the arch of this window is a quatrefoilâa beautifully crafted ornamental design of a four-petaled flower.</p><p>The four adjacent lancets feature the quatrefoil with four candlesticks decorated at their base with Messianic (or Christian) roses, (five white petals with yellow styles and stamens in the center), a symbol of the Messiah. Isaiah 35:1 says that when the Messiah comes into the world it will be like a desert that will âblossom as the rose.â Combined with the candlestick, it is a symbol that Christ, âthe Light of the Worldâ (John 8:12), is the fulfillment of the Old Testament prophecy.</p><p>These windows and the windows over the doors going into the Legislative Hall of the SC State House across the street make up one of the largest collections of Belcher Mosaic Glass in the world, outside of a museum. The quatrefoil is present in each of these four windows as well. These five windows in the apse behind the altar make an exquisite centerpiece for the cathedralâs other windows.</p><p><strong>Memorial: </strong>A memorial to the Reverend Peter Johnson Shand, D.D., was given by his congregation in loving commemoration of his faithful ministry at trinity church. Dr. Shand came from Charleston, S.C., in 1833 as a lay reader. He was ordained to the priesthood, became rector of Trinity in 1834, and served in that capacity until his death on All Saintsâ Day 1886. He is interred in the churchyard.</p></div>

This window shows one of them, a Samaritan, kneeling at Jesusâs feet and thanking him as the other nine walk away. Jesus asked, âWere there not ten cleansed? but where are the nine? There are not found that returned to give glory, save this stranger.â In the right lancet, Jesus raises his hand in blessing and says to the Samaritan âArise, go thy way: thy faith hath made thee whole.â (Luke 17:17-19)</p><p><span>In August of 1976, the Very Reverend James Stirling (1913-1979), Rector, then Dean of Trinity (1961-1978), corresponded with Henry Willet of Willet Studios in Philadelphia regarding replacing the clear glass of the original clerestory windows with stained glass. Mr. Willet suggested the miracles and parables of Jesus as subject matter and his studio executed the windows.

(Acts 8:1)</p><p>Acts 6:1-15 and 7:55-60 say Saint Stephen was the first-century martyr accused before the Sanhedrin. He was one of seven deacons appointed by the apostles to distribute alms.</p><p>Many Hebraic Jews objected to his preaching and charged him with blasphemy against Moses and God. While he was being charged, he saw a vision and was dragged out and stoned.</p><p>The two angels above St. Stephen represent the heavens and his vision. They are holding the rocks with which Saint Stephen was stoned and a book representing his studies.</p><p>Saint Stephen is dressed in a deaconâs dalmatic, a form of dress appropriate today but perhaps not in use in the first century.</p><p>This window was executed by Willet Studios of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, founded by William Willet (1869-1921) in 1899 partly in opposition to the wide use of opalescent glass, such as that in the Narthex partition. Willet thought that transparent stained glass better served the architectural purpose of windows and he emphasized the use of traditional medieval materials and techniques. Â By winning the commission over Louis Comfort Tiffany and others for the Cadet Chapel at the US Military Academy at West Point in 1910, he was considered the leading American stained glass artist. (Waggoner) His company today is known as Willet Hauser Architectural Glass. Â </p><p><strong>Memorial: </strong>Given by Frances Harvey Morris and family.</p></div>

        <div data-item="0"><p>This pair of lancets comprise one of the two windows in the Cathedral that illustrate the four prophets of the Old Testament. These portrayals of the Old Testament Prophets provide a wonderful parallel for the four Evangelists who are portrayed in the Narthex windows.</p><p>Daniel, who lived during the Babylonian Captivity, is shown in the center of the lancet with his hands together in prayer, as he did three times daily (Daniel 6:10). Daniel was known for his various visions in which he saw the future of Israel and the world.</p><p>The ramâs head at the top of the right lancet depicts Danielâs vision of a two-horned ram, which drives away those in all directions with impunity. The two horns represent the kings of the Medes and Persians (Daniel 8:8-9, 20).</p><p>At the bottom of the lancet, a lion reminds us of the story of Daniel in the lion-pit. Daniel 6:16-23 says King Darius issued an edict that said if anyone should present a petition to any god or human other than the king himself, that person would be thrown into the lion-pit. When Daniel disregarded the edict and continued to pray to his god, his enemies quickly told King Darius, who, with reluctance, followed through on his threat. As Daniel was being cast into the pit, the king said, âThy God whom thou servest continually, he will deliver thee.â When the king returned the next day, he found that God had sent an angel to close the lionsâ mouths and Daniel was saved.</p><p>Ezekiel, portrayed in the left lancet, is known for his prophecies regarding the destruction of Jerusalem and its temple, the restoration to Israel, and the new temple. Like Daniel, he lived during the Babylonian Captivity in the 6th century BC. Ezekielâs right hand is raised in blessing, his left hand holds a model of the new temple. As an exiled priest, he dealt with the everyday problems of worship in a foreign land, dreamed of a new Jerusalem, inspired hope and faith in his fellow exiles, and influenced the development of the synagogue.</p><p>Willet Studios executed these two lancet windows.</p><p><strong>Memorial: </strong>This window was given by family and friends to the glory of God and in loving memory of the Right Reverend John Adams Pinckney, 1905â1972, and Hilda P. Pinckney, Bishop Of The Diocese Of Upper South Carolina from 1963 to 1972. Bishop Pinckney is interred in the churchyard.</p></div>

        <div data-item="0"><p>This pair of lancets depict Old Testament prophets. Their arches are obscured in the church by a balcony support, but the obscured portion contains no pictorial subjects.</p><p>Jeremiah (right lancet), the ninth of the prophets is generally believed to be the author of the Book of Jeremiah, 1 Kings, 2 Kings, and the Book of Lamentations and is cited in the New Testament (Hebrews 8:8-12; 10.16-17). He lived in the late 7th century BC, some 60 years after the death of Isaiah. He correctly predicted the fall of Jerusalem and the destruction of Solomonâs Temple (Jeremiah 38:2). He was persecuted by his family, priests, and the princes of Judah, who threw him into a cistern, depicted at the top of this window, atop palm leaves, symbols of rejoicing.</p><p>Jeremiah is shown holding a stone. Tradition says he was stoned to death by the Jews in Egypt because of his unpopular messages against the rebellious Israelites.</p><p>Isaiah (left lancet) was a prophet who lived in the Kingdom of Judah in the 8-7th centuries B.C. when Assyria conquered the Kingdom of Israel, Judahâs northern neighbor. Judah allied itself with the Assyrians, lest its chief city, Jerusalem fall. Isaiah 37:1-23 tells of Isaiahâs prophecy to Judahâs king Hezekiah that God would visit His wrath on the invaders. The Assyrians lost 185,000 men and the king never attacked Judah again. (2 Kings 19; 2 Chronicles 32) Isaiah is best known for his âSong of the Suffering Servant,â (Isaiah 52:13-53:12), widely taken by Christians as a prophecy of the coming of the nature, suffering, and death of Jesus Christ. According to John 12:41, Isaiah âsaw [Jesusâ] glory and spake of him.â</p><p>Isaiah is here portrayed holding a saw. The Talmud (Yevamot 49b) and the Muslim tradition record that after the death of Hezekiah the unrighteous Israelites had Isaiah executed by being sawn in half (as was the Apostle James the Lesser), but there is no Christian authority for this.</p><p>The top of the window shows the scroll on which he recorded his prophecies, and a pair of tongs with which a seraph placed a live coal on Isaiahâs lips to purge him of his sins. (Isaiah 6.5-7)</p><p>The Willet Studio executed these two lancet windows.</p><p><strong>Memorial: </strong>This window was given to the glory of God and in loving memory of Jane Tucker Dana (1896-1972) and Francis Johnstone Dana (1890-1981) by Frank J. Dana, Frank J. Dana Jr., and Anne Dana Beach.</p></div>

Guided by the Holy Spirit, he went to the temple. When Mary and Joseph brought in the child âto do for him after the custom of the law,â (2:27) Simeon took him in his arms and praised the Lord saying: âLord, now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace, according to thy word. For mine eyes have seen thy salvation, which thou hast prepared before the face of all people; a light to lighten the Gentiles, and the glory of thy people Israel.â (2:29-32)</p><p>This passage appears also in the services of Evening Prayer and Compline in the Book of Common Prayer under the title <em>Nunc Dimittis</em>.</p><p>Luke 2:36-38 tells the story of Anna, who, after her husbandâs death, ânever left the temple but worshipped night and day with fasting and prayer.â She came upon the scene in the temple, thanked the Lord, and began to talk âabout the child to all who were looking for the liberation of Jerusalem.â</p><p><strong>Memorial: </strong>The window was given to the glory of God and in loving memory of Hugh Smith Thompson (1836-1904) and Elizabeth Clarkson Thompson (1840-1909) by their children and grandchildren.

Each petal of this window graphically presents twelve unique sayings of Jesus, (beginning at the position of one oâclock and moving clockwise).</p><ul><li>âI that speaketh unto thee am he [the Messiah]â (John 4:26) is depicted by the letters IHÎ£ at the heart of the sunburst.</li><li>âI am the bread of lifeâ (John 6:35) is depicted by wheat and a loaf of bread combined with the crux ansata (Latin: âcross with a handleâ), after the Egyptian hieroglyph Ankh, which means âlife.â</li><li>At Rev. 21:6 Jesus said âI will give unto him that is athirst of the fountain of the water of life.â The petal shows lambs drinking from a fountain of water pouring from a rock.</li><li>âBefore Abraham was, I amâ (John 8:58) is depicted by the palm branch of triumph, peace, and eternal life and crown of eternal rule.</li><li>âI am the light of the worldâ (John 8:12) is depicted by a candle lighting the globe.</li><li>âI am the doorâ (John 10:9) is depicted by a door.</li><li>âFor God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son, that whoever believeth in him should not perish, but have eternal life.â (John 3:16) is depicted by a hand. The hand is probably the best-known symbol of God the Father and the only one used for the first eight centuries.</li><li>âI am the true vine, and my Father is the husbandmanâ (John 15:1) is depicted by a grapevine and grapes.</li><li>âI am the way, the truth, and the lifeâ (John 14:6) is depicted by the combination of a path, a flaming torch, and the cross of life.</li><li>âYe call me Master and Lord: and ye say well; for I amâ (John 13:13) is depicted by a crown and scepter.</li><li>âI am the resurrection, and the lifeâ (John 11:25) is depicted by the phoenix, a mythological bird believed by the ancients to set its nest and itself on fire when old, only to be subsequently resurrected from the ashes.</li><li>âI am alpha (A) and omega (â¦), the beginning and the end, the first and the last.â (Rev. 22:13) Alpha and omega are the first and last letters of the Greek alphabet, symbolizing the eternity of our Savior.</li></ul><p><br />At the heart of the rose is the lamb of God, Agnus Dei. The lamb was a sacrificial animal in antiquity, which came to symbolize Jesus, who was sacrificed for our sins: St. John the Baptist, just after the baptism of Jesus, twice pointed him out saying, âBehold the lamb of God which taketh away the sin of the worldâ (John 1,29,36).</p><p>This window was created by the Willet Studios of Philadelphia, PA.</p><p><span><strong>Memorial:</strong> This window was given by the Hampton family as a memorial to all the members of the Hampton family, who have served this place since its founding in 1812.</span></p></div>

These windows were installed in the 1950s when Seibels Chapel was constructed as an addition to the Cathedral.Â </em></p><p>The cross in the foreground and the crown of thorns represent Christâs victory over death, selfishness, and pride by his suffering, death, and resurrection. This crown, plaited by the soldiers and placed on the head of Jesus during his trial before Pilate, was a mockery, a symbol of humiliation and suffering (John 19:2).</p><p>The feet of Christ ascending commemorate the ascension of Christ to heaven on the fortieth day after Easter, âHoly Thursday,â (Acts 1:9).</p><p>The shield of the blessed Trinity is pictured with the three curving sides, equal in length, carrying the Latin words, ânon estâ (is not), while the short straight bands have the word âestâ (is). The outer circles bear the words âPaterâ (Father), âFiliusâ (Son), and âSpiritus Sanctusâ (Holy Spirit). The inner circle bears the word âDeusâ (God). The circles emphasize eternity and Godâs never-ending love.</p><p>The Dove is the usual symbol of the Holy Spirit and always contains the triradiate nimbus around its head. The dove represents the descent of the Holy Spirit at Jesusâs baptism, and thus the gift of Godâs guidance at baptism.</p><p>The cross and white banner with red cross symbolize Christâs victory over death, sin, and the devil. The white banner represents the body of Christ, which is attached to the cruciform staff; the staff represents the cross on which Jesus died and through which the risen Christ saves the world. Red symbolizes the blood of martyrs.</p><p>The coins, basin, and towel represent Maundy Thursday, the betrayal of Judas, and the Last Supper. The coins are an emblem of the treachery of Judas in his conspiracy with the chief priests to betray Jesus (Matthew 26:15). On the night Jesus was betrayed, Maundy Thursday, he and his disciples met for the last meal together. He took a basin and washed their feet (John 13:5). This symbol along with the towel represents his humility and servitude, the evidence of Christâs love, and his estimate of true greatness in his kingdom.</p></div>

Carried by the Jews as a sign of triumphant rejoicing, the palm branches were spread before Jesus as he rode into Jerusalem just before his crucifixion (John 12:13).</p><p>The scourges, a symbol of passion, express the forty lashes minus one that Jesus suffered before his crucifixion.

        <div data-item="0"><p>Since the sacristy is the area where the Altar Guild performs its many duties, it is fitting that its window should portray the loving relationship in Bethany where Jesus lodged with Mary and Martha after his entry into Jerusalem.</p><p>Biblical texts portraying these distinctly human relationships are found in Matthew 26:6-13, Luke 10:38-42, John 11, and John 12:i1-11.</p><p>In the upper scene, Mary sits at the feet of Jesus while busy Martha chastises her for not helping to prepare the evening meal. Symbols at the top of the lancets explain each womanâs role. The low stoolâthe stool on which she sat at the masterâs feetâsymbolizes Mary. The water containerâthe symbol of liturgical purificationâsymbolizes Martha and parallels the cleansing of the house.</p><p>In the lower scene, another meeting between Jesus and this family of Bethany is illustrated. The scene includes Lazarus, the brother of Mary and Martha, whom Jesus had raised from the dead. (John 11) Mary anoints the feet of Jesus with costly ointment and wipes them with her hair. Judas, the groupâs treasurer, remonstrates at this extravagance; but Jesus replies, âThe poor always ye have with you, but me ye have not alwaysâ (John 12:8).</p><p>Memorial: This window was given to honor and hold in memory the Women of Trinity Cathedral Parish who have not only given faithful service but have sought a close relationship with God and the Christian family. Their names are listed on a plaque near the window. The donors are listed in the Trinity Memorials book.</p></div>

Two Roman soldiers had been stationed at the tomb, but the soldiers are asleep. Behind Jesus, and also guarded by soldiers, are the three crosses on Golgotha where he was crucified. The inscription reads, âAnd the third day He shall rise againâ (Luke 24:7). Jesus is surrounded by an aureole, an elongated nimbus used only in depictions of Jesus, or the Virgin and Child.</p><p>Beneath the inscription is a peacock, a symbol of immortality, particularly of Christ and the Resurrection, since when the peacock loses his feathers he gains back more beautiful ones.</p><p>The left lancet shows the feet of Christ ascending forty days after the Resurrection (Luke 24:50-53; Mark 16:19; Acts 1:9-11) as five disciples along with Mary and Mary Magdalene look on. Acts 1:2-9 states that he ascended in the presence of all eleven remaining Apostles. The inscription reads, âHe was taken up; and a cloud received Him out of their sightâ (Acts 1:9).</p><p><strong>Memorial: </strong>This window was given to the glory of God and in gratitude to Roberta Aldrich for her years of loving service to the children of Trinity Church by her âSunday School Childrenâ and friends.</p></div>

The baskets of grapes show that others have been working, harvesting grapes from the arbors like the one behind the worker. At the end of the day, the owner pays all the workers a denarius. The other workers complain that they have not been paid more than those who were hired later. Jesus says to one of them, âdidst not thou agree with me for a penny? Take that thine is, and go thy way: I will give unto this last, even as unto theeâ¦So the last shall be first, and the first last; for many be called, but few chosen.â (Matt. 20:13-16)</p><p><span>In August of 1976, the Very Reverend James Stirling (1913-1979), Rector, then Dean of Trinity (1961-1978), corresponded with Henry Willet of Willet Studios in Philadelphia regarding replacing the clear glass of the original clerestory windows with stained glass.

When Jesus came down in the evening, the disciples were being tossed on the sea by opposing winds. Jesus walked on the water toward the disciples, telling them, âBe of good cheer; it is I; be not afraid.â (Matt. 14:27) Peter then said, âLord, if it be thou, bid me come unto thee on the water.â (Matt. 14:28)</p><p>The left lancet shows Jesus walking on the water at night (stars in the sky) toward the boat, telling Peter âCome.â (Matt. 14:29) The right lancet shows Peter crossing the water with the other disciples huddled together in the boat.

The inscription beneath the scene reads., âIn the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, rise up.â</p><p>The lower part of the lancet shows a fountain whose waters pass beneath a bridge that turns the one stream into three, symbolizing the holy trinity.

The father agrees. The son wastes his share prodigiously in another town and facing starvation returns home offering to be one of his fatherâs servants. The father, however, greets him on the road home, and orders a fatted calf to be killed for a feast to celebrate his return. The elder son complains that he has behaved responsibly and honorably and has not even received a goat in return. The father replies that âIt was meet that we should make merry, and be glad: for this thy brother was dead, and is alive again; and was lost and is found.â (Luke 15:32)</p><p>In the left lancet, the rather poorly dressed son returns home as the industrious brother sits behind him with a spade.

At the center sits the Son, Jesus Christ, his hands and feet bearing the stigmata. Below the figure of Christ, in the lower portion of the central window, are seven candlesticks representing the seven churches of Asia (Rev. 1:20) Beneath these, a lamb stands on a book with seven seals and bears aloft the banner of victory of life over sin and death. (Rev.5) When the lamb opens the book seal by seal, he marks the Second Coming of Jesus. (Rev.6) To the left of the lamb are the four Old Testament prophets (Rev. 5:8-9). To the right of the lamb are four New Testament apostles.</p><p>The upper portion of the far right lancet illustrates Acts 2:2-13, showing the Holy Spirit in the form of a dove, as it appeared to Jesus in all four Gospels (Matt 3:16; Mark 1:10; Luke 3:22; John 1:32). In the lower portion of the leftmost lancet are four theologians. Below the saddle bar of the Great West Window are depictions of four American or English bishops and one preacher.</p><p>Henry Willet of Willet Glass worked with Bishop Fitz Allison on the design and execution of the Trinity Window, which was installed in 1968; and Willet Glass has, since then, done the remaining stained glass windows in the Cathedral.</p><p><strong>Memorial: </strong>This window was given in memory of Dr. J.

He is credited with writing 14 of the 27 books of the New Testament. Originally a persecutor of Christians named Saul of Tarsus, who witnessed and supported the stoning of St. Stephen, he was journeying from Jerusalem to Damascus on business when the resurrected Jesus appeared in a light that blinded Saul for three days. (Acts 9:1-29) At the top of the left lancet a beacon is inscribed with the words Jesus spoke to Saul: âSaul, why persecutest thou me?â (Acts 9:4) Blinding light from the beacon shines down on the group. The inscription reads âSuddenly there shone from Heaven a great light.â Below the inscription are the emblems of Paul, a book, indicating the scriptures surmounting a sword, the symbol of his martyrdom.</p><p>The right lancet shows St. Paul preaching to the Athenians outside the court that tried murder and corruption charges in Athens, the Areopagus (in the background is the triangular pediment of a Greek temple with columns). Paul tells the Athenians that they have an altar to an unknown god, to whom they pray in their ignorance, but the God who made the world does not live in âtemples made with hands.â (Acts 17:22-24). He tells them of the Resurrection; some scoff but some want to hear more later. The inscription reads, âAnd hath made of one blood all nations of men.â (Acts 17:26) Below the inscription is a cross with flame behind it, recalling Paulâs words, âThe Lord commanded us, saying, I have set thee to be a light of the Gentiles, that thou shouldst be for salvation unto the ends of the earth.

These windows, and the five on the north side depicting events in the life of Christ, were produced by Powell and Sons/Whitefriars.</em></p><p>The left lancet portrays St. Paulâs âvision in the nightâ of a Macedonian man, who begs him, âCome over into Macedonia and help usâ (Acts 16:9). Paul and Silas were in Troas, on the coast of Asia Minor, uncertain where to preach next. To judge by the nimbus surrounding the figureâs body, he is probably an angel adorned with blond hair that is typical of Macedonians like Alexander the Great. The large Roman province of Macedonia incorporated ancient Macedonia and many other territories. The vision calls Paul to extend the preaching of the Gospel from Asia to Europe.</p><p>The bottom of the lancet shows a sword with a snake coiled around it, the symbol of St. Paul, beneath the inscription âCome over into Macedonia and help us.â</p><p>The right lancet shows Paul standing in chains with balls and chains on his feet before King Herod Agrippa I, the Roman governor of Judea, and his sister Berenice (Acts 25:23-26:32) in Caesarea, where Paul had been imprisoned for two years. Behind Agrippa and Bernice is a tent canopy topped by an eagle, the symbol of Roman rule. In the lower left is Festus with the scroll containing the charges against Paul. The ball-and-chain shackles are shown in the lower part of the window beneath the inscription, âSo worship I the God of my Fathersâ (Acts 24:14).</p><p><strong>Memorial: </strong>This window was given in loving memory of Mary Heyward Belser, 1888-1942, by her husband and children.</p></div>

Jesus rebukes them saying, ââWhy are ye fearful, O ye of little faith?â then he arose, and rebuked the winds and the sea, and there was a great calm.â (Matt. 8:26)</p><p><span>In August of 1976, the Very Reverend James Stirling (1913-1979), Rector, then Dean of Trinity (1961-1978), corresponded with Henry Willet of Willet Studios in Philadelphia regarding replacing the clear glass of the original clerestory windows with stained glass.
